        <p class="w3-margin-left w3-ready" style="font-size:14px;"><%='Syntuition organization(2018) was
        established in order to offer practicals to theoretical sciences taught in classrooms by making students realise
         the beauty of science and not just about the beauty but also knowing what is involved in Laboratory work, in addition, it was also
         established in order to offer an opportunity to students who do have less access to laboratory facilities due to limited resources and infrastructure or any other
         reasons that hinder them from doing practicals in institutions,
               After six(6) months of establishment, the organization proposed to create a virtual
               3D laboratory which was going to identify them for and this 3D virtual laboratory came to be known as
                \'Synlab\' which came to be known as \'SkyLab\'. Not only SkyLab identifies Syntuition
        but also a large animation studio for artists
        who want to bring their traditional art stories to life for the purpose of
        entertainment. Therefore, what is SkyLab? SkyLab is
        an open source 3D virtual Laboratory project that is being created by
        the community who are Computer graphic designers, biologists, architects,
        chemists, teachers, computer programmers the list goes on. Creating SkyLab
        lab is done using 3D technology and other software, as a result we urge everyone to get
        involved for the love of science as well as 3D technology in order to prepare a way for the next
        generation to come.
        Last but not the least our animation studio reflects
        individuals creativity through skill or talent and
        storytelling by using powerful software.'%></p>
        <h2 class="w3-relativity w3-padding w3-text-brown w3-arima"><%='Why Syntuition and not other names?'%></h2>
        <article class="w3-padding w3-ready" style="font-size:14px;"><%="Syntuition is a combination of two words namely;"%> <span class="w3-text-teal"><%="Synthetic" %></span> <span class="w3-text-blue"><%='Intuition.' %></span> <%='one should think of Synthetic has a story,
          virtual experiments, code or picture that has been created by an artist,
          scientist or programmer, while intuition is the actual meaning
          of the word itself but in the world of art, science and programming.
          Thus, the organization was credited by artists and scientists who
          cared/loved/wanted to turn science experiments portrayed in books to life
          using 3D technology all over the world.'%></article>
        <h2 class="w3-relativity w3-padding w3-text-brown w3-arima"><%='After its establishment'%></h2>
        <p class="w3-padding w3-ready" style="font-size:14px;"> <%='Once it was established, many 3D artists, biologists,
          physicists, chemists, computer programmers and teacher, came on board and added
          on different programs to expand the laboratory. It was done so in order to
          improve the education system in Zambia.  The organization currently employs no
          individuals as it has not established its offices in Zambia but as soon as its
          projects start to find their way on the market, plans for establishing an office
          for administration, store, test lab, a class rooms, space for workshops/3D
          prints and a large studio for animation film productions will be commenced.'%> </p>
