Syntuition\'s vision for SkyLab is to make its 3D virtual laboratory indistinguishable from reality. This will be achieved by using software already put in place such as Blender, Godot and Krita the list goes on. Syntuition wants to turn every scientific phenomenon or experiment you see in science books to appear as if you were in a real laboratory environment. For example, testing for hydrogen using a glowing splint in real Laboratory environment will be just as the same as testing for hydrogen using a glowing splint in SkyLab. Therefore, don\'t worry about not having a proper laboratory at your school for everything you need is in SkyLab.'%></p>
